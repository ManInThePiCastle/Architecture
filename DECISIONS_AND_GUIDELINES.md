# Decisions and Guidelines

A set of rules governing how the services should be written

## Containerized

All services must be run inside a container.  This will allow for easier local development, and the ability to deploy the service anywhere.

## Language

Python is preferred

## API

The service must present an API

## Modules

Use as many 3rd part libraries as possible.  This will prevent us from writing too much code.
